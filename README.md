# Slavier
It's a Simple trojan that i made in free time.
As u can see, there's nothing big. Be free by adding anything you want :D

All u need is in the Code, but anyway... Here's a short tutorial


# Configurations(..)

U Just have to put your Local Ip and your port(u van Just imagine one.. It doesnt matter ) in Server.py
Then you have to do the same with the Client.py

# Running (..)

1- Open Server.py
2- Now u have to use pyinstaller and make a .exe of client.py, then u send It to the "victim".
3- The victim needs the Open the client.exe onde ( i assume you'll change the filename...)
